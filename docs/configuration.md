# Configuration

SoL-Pi reads one effective JSON configuration file at extension startup. It uses Pi's public `CONFIG_DIR_NAME` and `getAgentDir()` APIs rather than assuming fixed directories.

## Search order

1. `<working-directory>/<Pi config directory>/sol-pi.json`, only after Pi marks the project trusted
2. `<Pi agent directory>/sol-pi.json`
3. Built-in defaults when neither file exists

For the official Pi distribution, the first two locations normally resolve to `.pi/sol-pi.json` and `~/.pi/agent/sol-pi.json`.

The project file replaces the global file. SoL-Pi does not merge them.

## Schema

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "actionFusion": false,
  "actionFusionShell": "bash",
  "observationPack": false,
  "evidencePreservingReducer": false,
  "evidencePreservingReducerProvider": "provider-id",
  "evidencePreservingReducerModel": "model-id",
  "onlineContextCompact": false,
  "cacheWriteReadRatio": 12.5
}
```

Feature keys may be omitted and then default to `false`. `cacheWriteReadRatio` may be omitted and then defaults to `12.5`; when present it must be a finite non-negative number, and `0` explicitly means that a cache write adds no cost relative to a cache read. `evidencePreservingReducerProvider` and `evidencePreservingReducerModel` may be omitted and then use the built-in reducer route; when present each must be a non-empty string. Unknown keys, unsupported versions, malformed JSON, non-boolean feature values, invalid ratios, and invalid reducer model fields stop extension loading with a direct error.

For the managed all-enabled installation described in the [agent installation and configuration protocol](../agents-install.md), validate the effective file before starting Pi:

```bash
node scripts/check-sol-pi-config.mjs \
  --config /absolute/path/to/effective/sol-pi.json \
  --require-all-enabled
```

This preflight does not make every valid SoL-Pi configuration all-enabled. Without `--require-all-enabled`, omitted feature keys retain their normal `false` defaults. The managed workflow uses the flag because its acceptance criterion is that all four mechanisms are active.

## Feature behavior

- `actionFusion`: registers SoL-Pi replacements for Pi's `edit` and `write` tools.
- `actionFusionShell`: `"bash"` (default) or `"powershell"`. Selects the shell for `then_run`; the latter launches PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) directly without Bash. Invalid values stop loading. The selection is explicit and does not change automatically with the OS.
- `observationPack`: registers `obs_recall` and a provider-context projection handler.
- `evidencePreservingReducer`: registers a `tool_result` handler and delegates long diagnostic-log reduction to the configured reducer provider/model.
- `evidencePreservingReducerProvider`: provider namespace used to resolve the reducer model through Pi's model registry.
- `evidencePreservingReducerModel`: model id used for Evidence-Preserving Reducer.
- `onlineContextCompact`: registers `update_plan` and boundary-driven native compaction after the other SoL-Pi context transformers.
- `cacheWriteReadRatio`: supplies the single economic decision ratio used by Online Context Compact.

## Evidence-Preserving Reducer runtime inputs

The release entry supplies the run label and session-derived storage. It uses one configurable model route:

- **Reducer provider/model** — from `evidencePreservingReducerProvider` and `evidencePreservingReducerModel` in the effective `sol-pi.json`. If omitted, SoL-Pi uses its built-in reducer route. SoL-Pi resolves that model through Pi's model registry and still relies on Pi-managed authentication; do not put credentials in `sol-pi.json`.

## Online Context Compact runtime inputs

The release entry uses two runtime inputs:

- **Context window** — from `ExtensionContext.getContextUsage()`, used for window-pressure protection.
- **Cache write/read ratio** — from `cacheWriteReadRatio` in the effective `sol-pi.json`. The value remains fixed for the session and is not recomputed when the model changes. It drives one runtime decision and is not a cost report.

The configured ratio stays fixed for the loaded extension. The mechanism stores its current plan, progress summaries, request horizon, context growth, and compaction debt as versioned custom entries in Pi's session log. After a successful compaction it sends one hidden, generic message with `triggerTurn: true`, which starts a new turn and asks the assistant to continue the current plan, preserving existing step IDs when updating progress. A settlement barrier keeps print and JSON modes in the same Pi invocation until that continuation settles, so callers do not need to resume the session or inject `Continue working`. Cancelling or exiting does not schedule an automatic continuation. The mechanism creates no separate Online Context Compact files. The programmatic factory exposes only a matching retained-tail value for installations whose Pi compaction setting differs from the default.

## Pi integration

SoL-Pi reads no dedicated environment variables. Evidence-Preserving Reducer resolves its configured reducer provider/model through `ExtensionContext.modelRegistry` and uses Pi-managed authentication. If the configured reducer model is unavailable or the nested model call fails, the original tool result continues unchanged.

SoL-Pi does not configure shell paths, command prefixes, storage paths, run IDs, provider URLs, reasoning levels, timeouts, or per-mechanism enable flags through environment variables. Apart from the EPR reducer provider/model route in `sol-pi.json`, model selection remains with Pi. Action Fusion uses Pi's default Bash launcher unless `actionFusionShell` explicitly selects native PowerShell 7. Persistent artifacts are derived from Pi's session directory and session ID.

## Native PowerShell follow-up commands

With `actionFusionShell: "powershell"`, `then_run.command` is PowerShell code, not Bash code. SoL-Pi runs `pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -File` with a temporary UTF-8 script, the tool's working directory and inherited environment. No shell-path setting, profile loading, execution-policy bypass, or automatic fallback is provided. PowerShell 5.1 is not supported. Programmatic `ActionFusionOptions.shell` uses the same values; `bashOptions` cannot be combined with PowerShell mode.

The executable and timeout are checked before mutation. A supplied timeout must be finite and positive; omission imposes no timeout. PowerShell errors and nonzero native exit codes fail the follow-up. The last native exit code is propagated; explicitly check intermediate native commands when chaining multiple commands. An explicit `exit` retains its meaning. Command failure, cancellation, or timeout after mutation does **not** roll back the edit/write.

Cancellation and timeout request process-tree termination (`taskkill /T /F` on Windows, process-group termination on POSIX). Cleanup failures are reported. Detached processes and forced termination of Pi itself are not guaranteed to be cleaned up.

Output is decoded as UTF-8. The returned tail is limited to 2,000 lines / 50 KiB, with a full-log path on truncation or failure. Separate stdout/stderr arrival order is not a guarantee of their original emission order. Command scripts are deleted on completion; output logs remain under a unique `sol-pi-pwsh-*` directory in the OS temporary directory until host/caller cleanup. Use a trusted user-owned temporary directory: POSIX mode bits do not guarantee Windows ACL isolation. ObservationPack can archive the returned tool result, but full PowerShell-log reduction by EPR is outside this profile's support guarantee.

## Trust

A project-local config can enable file mutation, shell execution, local archival, and remote diagnostic-log reduction. SoL-Pi waits for Pi's `session_start` context and ignores the project file unless `ctx.isProjectTrusted()` is true. Prefer the global file when you want one personal configuration across trusted projects.
